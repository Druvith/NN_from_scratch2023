Derivative vs Gradient:

A derivative is a single number that represents the rate of change of a function at a particular point. For example, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 at the point x = 2 is 4. This means that the function is increasing at a rate of 4 at the point x = 2.

A gradient is a vector that represents the rate of change of a function in all directions. The gradient of the function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 at the point (2, 2) is the vector <4, 4>. This means that the function is increasing at a rate of 4 in the x-direction and at a rate of 4 in the y-direction at the point (2, 2).


Workflow:
1.The data that we can learn from.

2.A model of how to transform the data.

3.An objective function that quantifies how well (or badly) the model is doing.

4.An algorithm to adjust the modelâ€™s parameters to optimize the objective function
